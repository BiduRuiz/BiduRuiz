# Hi, My name is Gabriela (or Bidu)! 👋

Let me explain a little about my repositories:

- **mathfoundq**: This repository is used to build and update the [website](https://www.ime.unicamp.br/~mfq/) of the Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Theory Group at UNICAMP. 🌐
- **SDP_LocalModels**: This repository was used to build and now store the results constructed in my Master's. 📚

If you want to know a little more, read the ReadMes in each repository 😃📖
